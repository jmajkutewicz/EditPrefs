If one places <math> 0.9 </math>, <math> 0.99 </math>, <math> 0.999 </math>, etc. on the number line, one sees immediately that all these points are to the left of 1, and that they get closer and closer to 1. For any number <math>x</math> that is less than 1, the sequence <math> 0.9 </math>, <math> 0.99 </math>, <math> 0.999 </math>, and so on will eventually reach a number larger than <math>x</math>. So, it does not make sense to identify <math> 0.999\ldots</math> with any number smaller than 1. Meanwhile, every number larger than 1 will be larger than any decimal of the form <math>0.999\ldots9</math> for any finite number of nines. Therefore, <math> 0.999\ldots</math> cannot be identified with any number larger than 1, either. Because <math>0.999\ldots</math> cannot be bigger than 1 or smaller than 1, it must equal 1 if it is to be any real number at all.
