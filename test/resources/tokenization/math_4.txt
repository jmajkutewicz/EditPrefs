The Casimir invariants for negative energies are
 <math>
C_1 = \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{L} = \frac{mk^2}{2|E|},
</math>
 <math>
C_2 = \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{L} = 0,
</math>

and have vanishing Poisson brackets with all components of D and L,
 <math>
\{ C_1, L_i \} = \{ C_1, D_i\} =
\{ C_2, L_i \} = \{ C_2, D_i \} = 0.
</math>
"C"2 is trivially zero, since the two vectors are always perpendicular.

However, the other invariant, "C"1, is non-trivial and depends only on "m", "k" and "E".  Upon canonical quantization, this invariant allows the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms to be derived using only quantum mechanical canonical commutation relations, instead of the conventional solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation. This derivation is discussed in detail in the next section.
