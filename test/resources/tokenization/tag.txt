Due to the cancellation of her 2020 tour, Hamasaki held an online concert named "Trouble Tour 2020 A: Saigo no Trouble Final" on October 2. This was without an in-person audience, the stream being hosted by Mu-mo Live. On December 2, the singer also performed "Ohia no Ki" as part of the FNS Music Festival. Later that same month, Hamasaki planned to hold an in-person Christmas concert titled "Special Showcase Xmas Eve 2020," but it was later adapted to be a streaming exclusive via YouTube on December 24. "Countdown Live 2020-2021 A: Music For Life," two New Year concerts for December 30 and 31, were cancelled on December 29 due to a member of staff testing positive with COVID-19. Hamasaki later confirmed she was following isolation instructions and had not tested positive herself.
