'''Hu Zhengyan''' ({{zh|s=胡正言}}; {{circa}} 1584{{spaced ndash}}1674) was a Chinese artist, printmaker and publisher. He worked in [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese painting]], and [[Seal (East Asia)|seal-carving]], but was primarily a publisher, producing academic texts as well as records of his own work.

Hu lived in [[Nanjing]] during the transition from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the [[Hongguang Emperor]], but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]], and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various [[Color printing#China|multi-colour printing]] and [[Paper embossing|embossing]] techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form.

Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled ''The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy'', an artist's primer which remained in print for around 200 years. His studio also published seal catalogues, academic and medical texts, books on poetry, and decorative writing papers. Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers.

During Hu's lifetime, the [[Ming dynasty]], which had ruled China for over 250 years, was [[Qing conquest of the Ming|overthrown and replaced]] by China's last imperial dynasty, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]. Following the fall of the capital [[Beijing]] in 1644, remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a [[Southern Ming|Ming loyalist regime]] in [[Nanjing]] with [[Zhu Yousong]] on the throne as the Hongguang Emperor.<ref name="TwitchettFairbank1988">{{cite book|last1=Twitchett|first1=Denis Crispin|last2=Fairbank|first2=John King|title=The Cambridge History of China: The Ming dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&pg=PA641|access-date=31 May 2013|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|page=642}}</ref> Hu, who was noted for his seal-carving and facility with [[seal script]],  created a [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] for the new Emperor. The court offered him the position of Drafter for the Secretariat (''zhongshu sheren'', {{zh|t=中書舍人|labels=no}}) as a reward, but he did not accept the role (although he did accord himself the title of ''zhongshu sheren'' in some of his subsequent personal seals).<ref name=Wright/>

According to Wen Ruilin's ''Lost History of the South'' (''Nanjiang Yishi'', {{zh|t=南疆繹史|labels=no}}), prior to the [[Qing conquest of the Ming#Jiangnan|Qing invasion of Nanjing]] Hu studied at [[Nanjing University|the National University]] there, and whilst a student was employed by the [[Ministry of Rites]] to record official proclamations; he produced the ''Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning'' (''Qin Ban Xiaoxue'', {{zh|t=御頒小學|labels=no}}) and the ''Record of Displayed Loyalty'' (''Biaozhong Ji'', {{zh|t=表忠記|labels=no}}) as part of this work. As a result, he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained admittance to the [[Hanlin Academy]], but before he could take up this appointment, Beijing had fallen to the [[Manchu]] rebellion.<ref name="温睿臨1971">{{cite book|last=温睿臨|title=南疆逸史|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23bTAAAAMAAJ|access-date=31 May 2013|year=1971|publisher=崇文書店|pages=306–307|language=zh}}</ref> Since contemporaneous biographies (Wen's work was not published until 1830) make no mention of these events, it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu's death.<ref name=Wright/>

Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646, after the end of the Ming dynasty.<ref name="杜濬1894"/> [[Xiao Yuncong]] and [[Lü Liuliang]] recorded visiting him during his later years, in 1667 and 1673 respectively.<ref name=SunShaobin/> He died in poverty at the age of 90, sometime around late 1673 or early 1674.<ref name=Wright/>

==Seal-carving==
[[File:Hu Zhengyan Seal Comp.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Six Chinese seal impressions|Examples of Hu Zhengyan's seal carving]]
Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries. His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the [[Han dynasty]], and he followed the [[Huizhou (region)|Huizhou]] school of carving founded by his contemporary [[He Zhen (artist)|He Zhen]]. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear compositional structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals.<ref name=Wright/>

Hu's work was known outside his local area.  [[Zhou Lianggong]], a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur, stated in his ''Biography of Seal-Carvers'' (''Yinren Zhuan'', {{zh|t=印人傳|labels=no}}) that Hu "creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure",<ref>{{cite book|title=印人传|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82FkuAAACAAJ|access-date=3 June 2013|year=2000|publisher=海南出版社|isbn=978-7-80645-663-7|language=zh}}</ref> implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing.<ref name=Wright/><ref name=Wright2>{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Suzanne E.|title="Luoxuan biangu jianpu" and "Shizhuzhai jianpu": Two Late-Ming Catalogues of Letter Paper Designs|journal=Artibus Asiae|date=2003|volume=63|issue=1|pages=69–115|jstor=3249694}}</ref>

In 1644, Hu took it upon himself to create a new [[Heirloom Seal of the Realm|Imperial seal]] for the Hongguang Emperor, which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer. He presented his creation with an essay, the ''Great Exhortation of the Seal'' (''Dabao Zhen'', {{zh|t=大寶箴|labels=no}}), in which he bemoaned the loss of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]]'s seal and begged Heaven's favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally-footed couplets (''pianti'', {{zh|t=駢體|labels=no}}) used in the [[Imperial examination]]s, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court.<ref name="杜濬1894">{{cite book|last=杜濬|title=變雅堂遺集|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVXmAAAAMAAJ|access-date=31 May 2013|year=1894|publisher=上海古籍出版社|pages=18–20|isbn=9787532524600|language=zh}}</ref>

Despite his reputation as an artist and seal-carver, Hu was primarily a publisher. His publishing house, the Ten Bamboo Studio, produced reference works on calligraphy, poetry and art; medical textbooks; books on etymology and phonetics; and copies of as well as commentaries on the [[Four Books and Five Classics#Four Books|Confucian Classics]]. Unlike other publishers in the area, the Ten Bamboo Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels.<ref name="BrokawChow2005">{{cite book|last1=Brokaw|first1=Cynthia J.|last2=Chow|first2=Kai-Wing|title=Printing and book culture in late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2DjFx_RbjkC&pg=PA131|access-date=29 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23126-9|page=131}}</ref> This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio's location: the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the Nanjing [[Guozijian]] (National Academy), which provided a captive market for academic texts.<ref name="馬孟晶1993">{{cite book|last=馬孟晶|title=晚明金陵"十竹齋書畫譜""十竹齋箋譜"硏究|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpLzSAAACAAJ|access-date=3 June 2013|year=1993|publisher=National Taiwan University Dept. of Art History|pages=29–30|language=zh}}</ref> Between 1627 and 1644, the Ten Bamboo Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind, aimed at a wealthy, literary audience.<ref name="Chow2004">{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Kai-Wing|title=Publishing, culture, and power in early modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-_l3tDB47AC&pg=PA84|access-date=29 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3368-7|page=84}}</ref> The studio's earliest publications were medical textbooks, the first of which, ''Tested Prescriptions for Myriad Illnesses'' (''Wanbing Yanfang'', {{zh|t=萬病驗方|labels=no}}) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later. Hu's brother Zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books.<ref name=Wright/>

During the 1630s the Ten Bamboo Studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the Ming; these included the ''Imperial Ming Record of Loyalty'' (''Huang Ming Biaozhong Ji'', {{zh|t=皇明表忠紀|labels=no}}), a biography of loyal Ming officials, and the ''Edicts of the Imperial Ming'' (''Huang Ming Zhaozhi'', {{zh|t=皇明詔制|labels=no}}), a list of Imperial proclamations. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Hu renamed the studio the Hall Rooted in the Past  (''Digutang'', {{zh|t=迪古堂|labels=no}}) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty, although the Ten Bamboo imprint continued to be used. Despite Hu's withdrawal from society after 1646, the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty, for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu's carving work.<ref name=Wright/>

In some images, Hu employed a blind embossing technique (known as "embossed designs" (''gonghua'', {{zh|t=拱花|labels=no}}) or "embossed blocks" (''gongban'',  {{zh|t=拱板|labels=no}}), using an uninked, imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper.

==Major works==
[[File:Hu Zhengyan - Bamboo in snow 1.PNG|thumbnail|''Bamboo in snow'' from the 'Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy'']]
Hu's most notable work is the ''Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy'' (''Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu'', {{zh|t=十竹齋書畫譜|labels=no}}), an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, [[Bamboo painting|bamboo]], flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes.<ref name="NeedhamTsuen-Hsuin1985"/> As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy.

===Other publications===
Other works produced by Hu's studio included a reprint of [[Zhou Boqi]]'s manual of seal-script calligraphy, ''The Six Styles of Calligraphy, Correct and Erroneous'' (''Liushu Zheng'e'', {{zh|t=六書正譌|labels=no}}) and the related ''Necessary Investigations into Calligraphy'' (''Shufa Bi Ji'', {{zh|t=書法必稽|labels=no}}), which discussed common errors in the formation of characters. With his brother Zhengxin, Hu edited a new introductory edition of the [[Chinese classics|Confucian classics]], entitled ''The Standardised Text of the [[Four Books and Five Classics#Four Books|Four Books]], Identified and Corrected'' (''Sishu Dingben Bianzheng'', {{zh|t=四書定本辨正|labels=no}}) (1640), giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text. A similar approach was taken with the ''Essentials of the [[Thousand Character Classic]] in Six Scripts'' (''Qianwen Liushu Tongyao'', {{zh|t=千文六書統要|labels=no}}) (1663), which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher, Li Deng. It was published after Li's death, partly in homage to him.<ref name=Wright/>

The three Hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye Tingxiu, which was called simply the ''Discussion of Poetry'' (''Shi Tan'', {{zh|t=詩譚|labels=no}}) (1635). Other works on poetry from the studio included ''Helpful Principles to the Subtle Workings of Selected Tang Poems'' (''Leixuan Tang Shi Zhudao Weiji'', {{zh|t=類選唐詩助道微機|labels=no}}), which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]] by Hu Zhengyan himself.<ref name=Wright/>

Among the studio's more obscure publications was a text on [[Chinese dominoes]] entitled ''Paitong Fuyu'' ({{zh|t=牌統浮玉|labels=no}}), written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu Zhengyan.<ref name=Wright/>
