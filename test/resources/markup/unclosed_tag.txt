'''Bob Dylan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|l|ən}}; born '''Robert Allen Zimmerman''', May 24, 1941) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], artist and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he both a chronicler and figurehead of social unrest. Early songs such as "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" became anthems for the American [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|civil rights]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] movements. Leaving his base in [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]], Dylan's six-minute single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" altered popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings, backed by [[rock music]]ians, reached the top end of the [[Billboard charts|United States music charts]] while attracting [[Electric Dylan controversy|denunciation and criticism]] from others in the folk movement.

Dylan's lyrics have political, social, philosophical and literary influences. They defied pop conventions and appealed to the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. Inspired by the performances of [[Little Richard]], and the songwriting of [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Hank Williams]], Dylan amplified and personalized musical [[Music genre|genres]]. His recording career, spanning 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song — from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], and [[Country music|country]] to [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock and roll]], and [[rockabilly]] to [[Folk music of England|English]], [[Scottish folk music|Scottish]], and [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]], embracing [[jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]]. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the [[Never Ending Tour]]. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is considered his songwriting.

Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling artists of all time]]; he has [[List of awards received by Bob Dylan|numerous awards]] including [[Grammy]], [[Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award]]; he has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Minnesota Music Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. The [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury in 2008 awarded him a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|citation]] for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power." In May 2012, Dylan received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Barack Obama]].

==Life and career==

===Origins and musical beginnings===
Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman ([[Hebrew]] name שבתאי זיסל בן אברהם [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])<ref>Sounes, p. 14, gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham</ref><ref>A [[Chabad]] news service gives the variant Zushe ben Avraham, which may be a [[Yiddish]] variant {{cite web | url = http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm | title = Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate =September 11, 2008 | publisher=Chabad.org News }}</ref> in St Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]],<ref>Sounes, p. 14</ref><ref name=mnbirth>{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?ti=0&indiv=try&db=mnbirth&h=9920599|title=Robert Allen Zimmerman|work=Minnesota Birth Index, 1935–2002|publisher=Ancestry.com|quote=Name: Robert Allen Zimmerman; Birth Date: 24 May 1941; Birth County: Saint Louis; Father: Abram H. Zimmerman; Mother: Beatrice Stone|accessdate=September 6, 2011}}{{subscription required}}</ref> and raised in [[Hibbing, Minnesota]], on the [[Mesabi Range]] west of [[Lake Superior]]. Dylan's paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from [[Odessa]] in the [[Russian Empire]] now [[Ukraine]], to the United States following anti-Semitic [[Odessa pogroms#1905 Pogrom|pogroms of 1905]].<ref name = "Sounes-p12">Sounes, pp. 12–13.</ref> His maternal grandparents, Ben and Florence Stone, were [[Lithuanian Jews]] who arrived in the United States in 1902.<ref name = "Sounes-p12"/> In his autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from [[Kağızman]] district of [[Kars Province]] in north-eastern Turkey.<ref>Dylan, pp. 92–93.</ref>

Dylan's parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community. Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six, when his father had polio and the family returned to his mother's home town, Hibbing, where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood. Robert Zimmerman spent his early years listening to the radio — first to [[blues]] and [[country music|country stations]] from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and, as a teen, to rock and roll.<ref name = "Shelton-38">Shelton, pp. 38–40.</ref> Zimmerman formed several bands while attending [[Hibbing High School]].

Zimmerman moved to [[Minneapolis]] in September 1959 and enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]]. His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk. In 1985, he said:

{{quotation|The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough&nbsp;... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms&nbsp;... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>}}

He began to perform at the Ten&nbsp;O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became involved in the [[Dinkytown]] [[folk music]] circuit.<ref>Shelton, pp. 65–82.</ref><ref name = "No Direction Home">This is related in the documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'', Director: [[Martin Scorsese]]. Broadcast: September 26, 2005, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] & [[BBC Two]]</ref>

During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 7.</ref><ref group=a>According to Dylan's biographer, [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], the singer first confided his change of name to his high school girlfriend Echo Helstrom in 1958, telling her he had found a "great name, Bob Dillon". Shelton surmises Dillon had two sources: [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing's principal families. Dylan told Shelton: "Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance." At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. The singer later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton adds that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name 'Dylan', by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44–45.</ref> In his memoir, Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Dylan, pp. 78–79.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."<ref name = "60minutes2005"/>

===1960s===

====Relocation to New York and record deal====
In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, to perform there and visit his musical idol, [[Woody Guthrie]],<ref>Sounes, p. 72</ref> who was seriously ill with [[Huntington's disease]] in [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact, he wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them&nbsp;... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple."<ref>Dylan, pp. 244–246.</ref> As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's acolyte, [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'' (2004).<ref>Dylan, pp. 250–252.</ref>

From February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around [[Greenwich Village]]. He befriended and picked up material from folk singers there, including [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Odetta]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], and Irish musicians [[The Clancy Brothers|The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]].<ref>Shelton (2011), pp. 74–78.</ref> In September, Dylan gained public recognition when Shelton wrote a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of a show at [[Gerde's Folk City]].<ref>Shelton, Robert (September 21, 1961).

Dylan legally changed his name to Bob Dylanin August 1962 <ref>Sounes, p. 121.</ref> and he signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]].<ref>Sounes, p. 116.</ref> (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.)<ref>Sounes, pp.&nbsp;94–95, 115. An interview with Silver on DVD, filmed for the documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]'' but not used, was included with the album ''[[Together Through Life]]''.</ref> Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 283–284.</ref> Dylan said, "He was kind of like a [[Colonel Tom Parker]] figure&nbsp;... you could smell him coming."<ref name = "No Direction Home" /> Tensions between Grossman and [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] led to Hammond's being replaced as producer of Dylan's second album by the young Africa- American jazz producer, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]].<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 115–116.</ref>

By the time Dylan's of second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer and a songwriter. Many songs on this album were labeled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s passion for topical songs.<ref>Shelton, pp. 138–142.</ref> "Oxford Town", for example, was an account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, p. 156.</ref>

His most famous song at this time, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", partly derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song, "No More Auction Block". Its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.<ref>The booklet by [[John Bauldie]] accompanying Dylan's ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991]]'' (1991) says: "Dylan acknowledged the debt in 1978 to journalist Marc Rowland: ''Blowin' In The Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' In The Wind follows the same feeling.{{' "}} pp. 6–8.</ref> The song was widely recorded and became a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]. Many other artists had hits with Dylan's songs. "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]" was based on the folk ballad "[[Lord Randall]]". With veiled references to an impending apocalypse, the song gained more resonance when the [[Cuban missile crisis]] developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 101–103.</ref><ref group=a>In a May 1963 interview with [[Studs Terkel]], Dylan broadened the meaning of the song, saying "the pellets of poison flooding the waters" refers to "the lies people are told on their radios and in their newspapers". Cott (2006), p. 8.</ref> Like "Blowin' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagism|imagist]] lyrical attack with traditional folk form.<ref>Ricks, pp. 329–344.</ref>

While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, ''Freewheelin''' included love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues. Humor was a part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderful."<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993.</ref>

The rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an attraction to others. [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying."<ref>Hedin, p. 259.</ref> Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan's advocate as well as his lover.<ref>Sounes, pp. 136–138.</ref> Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray (2006), pp. 28–31.</ref>

Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included [[The Byrds]]; [[Sonny & Cher]]; [[The Hollies]]; [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; [[The Association]]; [[Manfred Mann]]; and [[The Turtles]]. Most attempted a pop feel and rhythm, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk. The covers became so ubiquitous that [[CBS]] promoted him with "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/bob-dylans-songs-offer-rich-pickings-for-other-singers/2007/08/14/1186857512999.html | title = It ain't me babe but I like how it sounds | date = August 15, 2007 | accessdate =September 24, 2008 | last = Meacham | first = Steve |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

The single "Mixed Up Confusion", recorded during the ''Freewheelin''' sessions with a backing band, was quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]]."<ref>[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]]. Musicians on "Mixed Up Confusion": George Barnes & [[Bruce Langhorne]] (guitars); [[Dick Wellstood]] (piano); [[Gene Ramey]] (bass); [[Herb Lovelle]] (drums)</ref>

====Protest and ''Another Side''====
In May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by [[CBS]] television's head of program practices that "[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]" was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<ref>Dylan had recorded "Talkin' John Birch Society Blues" for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|''Freewheelin'']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including "[[Masters of War]]". See Heylin (2000), pp. 114–115.</ref>

 |format = [[Ogg]]}}

By this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|civil rights movement]], singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963.<ref>Dylan performed "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" and "[[When the Ship Comes In]]"; see Heylin (1996), p. 49.</ref> Dylan's third album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]'', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan.<ref>Gill, pp. 37–41.</ref> The songs often took contemporary stories, with "Only A Pawn In Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]]; and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.<ref>Ricks, pp. 221–233.</ref> On a more general theme, "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]" and "[[North Country Blues]]" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings".<ref>Williams, p. 56.</ref>

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by folk and protest .<ref>Shelton, pp. 200–205.</ref> Accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, called the members old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>Part of Dylan's speech went: "There's no black and white, left and right to me any more; there's only up and down and down is very close to the ground. And I'm trying to go up without thinking of anything trivial such as politics."; see, Shelton, pp. 200–205.</ref>

''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', recorded one evening in June 1964,<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 60.</ref> had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free No.&nbsp;10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "[[Spanish Harlem Incident]]" and "[[To Ramona]]" are passionate love songs, while "[[Black Crow Blues]]" and "[[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]]" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the reputation thrust at him.<ref>Shelton, p. 222.</ref> His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]", which sets [[social commentary]] against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images,"<ref>In an interview with Seth Goddard for ''Life'' (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg said Dylan's technique had been inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]: "(Dylan) pulled ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' from my hand and started reading it and I said, 'What do you know about that?' He said, 'Somebody handed it to me in '59 in St. Paul and it blew my mind.' So I said 'Why?' He said, 'It was the first poetry that spoke to me in my own language.' So those chains of flashing images you get in Dylan, like 'the motorcycle black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom lover,' they're influenced by Kerouac's chains of flashing images and spontaneous writing, and that spreads out into the people."

In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to [[folk-rock]] pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed "[[Beatle boot]]s". A London reporter wrote: "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of [[Leicester Square]]. He looks like an undernourished [[cockatoo]]."<ref>Shelton, pp. 267–271; pp. 288–291.</ref> Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the [[Les Crane]] television show and asked about a movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, "No, I play my mother."<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 178–181.</ref>

====Going electric====

Dylan's April 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' was another leap,<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 181–182.</ref> his first with electric instruments. The first single, "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]", owed much to [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]";<ref>Heylin (2009), pp. 220–222.</ref> its free association lyrics described as harkening back to the energy of [[beat poetry]] and as a forerunner of [[rapping|rap]] and [[hip-hop]].<ref>Marqusee, p. 144.</ref> The song was provided with an early video, which opened [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s [[cinéma vérité]] presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of Great Britain, ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.<ref>Gill, pp. 68–69.</ref> Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.<ref>Lee, p. 18.</ref>

The second side of ''Bringing It All Back Home'' wasd four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.<ref name = "Sounes-168">Sounes, pp. 168–169.</ref> "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" became one of his best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK .<ref>{{cite book|author=Warwick, N., Brown, T. & Kutner, J.|year=2004|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|edition=Third|page=6|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84449-058-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Whitburn, J.|page=130|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955–2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}</ref> "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]" and "[[It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]" were two of Dylan's most important compositions.<ref name = "Sounes-168"/><ref>Shelton, pp. 276–277.</ref>

In 1965, heading the [[Newport Folk Festival]], Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a [[pickup group]] mostly from the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] (guitar), [[Sam Lay]] (drums) and Jerome Arnold (bass), plus [[Al Kooper]] (organ) and [[Barry Goldberg]] (piano).<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 208–216.</ref> Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. [[Murray Lerner]], who filmed the performance, said: "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/10/exclusive_dylan_at_newport_who.html| title = Exclusive: Dylan at Newport—Who Booed?| work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]

Nevertheless, Dylan's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.<ref>Shelton, pp. 305–314.</ref><ref>A year earlier, [[Irwin Silber]], editor of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', had published an "Open Letter to Bob Dylan", criticizing Dylan's stepping away from political songwriting: "I saw at Newport how you had somehow lost contact with people. Some of the paraphernalia of fame were getting in your way." ''Sing Out!'', November 1964, quoted in Shelton, p. 313. This letter has been mistakenly described as a response to Dylan's 1965 Newport appearance.</ref> In the September issue of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time&nbsp;...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers&nbsp;... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel."<ref>''Sing Out!'', September 1965, quoted in Shelton, p. 313.</ref> On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was in New York, recording "[[Positively 4th Street]]". The lyrics had images of vengeance and paranoia,<ref>"You got a lotta nerve/To say you are my friend/When I was down/You just stood there grinning" Reproduced online:{{cite web | url = http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/positively-4th-street | title = Positively 4th Street| author=Bob Dylan| accessdate =September 30, 2008| publisher=bobdylan.com}}</ref> and it was interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community — friends he had known in clubs along West 4th Street.<ref>Sounes, p. 186.</ref>

====''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''====
{{listen|filename=Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone.ogg |title="Like a Rolling Stone"|description=Dylan's 1965 hit single, which appeared on the album ''Highway 61 Revisited''. In 2004, it was chosen as the greatest song of all time by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.<ref name = "RS500"/>|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In July 1965, the single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" peaked at two in the U.S. and at four in the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song altered what a pop single could convey. [[Bruce Springsteen]], in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], said that on first hearing the single, "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind".<ref>Springsteen's Speech during Dylan's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], January 20, 1988 Quoted in Bauldie, p. 191.</ref> In 2004 and in 2011, ''Rolling Stone'' listed it as number one of "[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]".<ref name = "RS500">{{cite web| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html#500Songs| title = The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=Rock List Music}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-20110516| title = 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date = May 31, 2011| accessdate =June 1, 2011|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The song opened Dylan's next album, ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'', after the road that led Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.<ref>Gill, pp. 87–88.</ref> The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by [[Mike Bloomfield]]'s blues guitar and [[Al Kooper]]'s organ riffs. "[[Desolation Row]]", backed by [[acoustic guitar]] and understated bass,<ref>Polizzotti identifies [[Charlie McCoy]] on guitar and [[Russ Savakus]] on bass as the musicians, see Polizzotti, ''Highway 61 Revisited'', p. 133</ref> offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a [[Frederico Fellini|Fellini-esque]] parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical ([[Einstein]], [[Nero]]), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary ([[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]]), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse."<ref>Gill, p. 89.</ref>

In support, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and [[Harvey Brooks]] from his studio crew and [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Levon Helm]], former members of [[Ronnie Hawkins]]'s backing band [[The Hawks (band)|The Hawks]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 80–81</ref> On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was more favorable.<ref>Sounes, pp. 189–90.</ref>

From September 24, in Austin, Texas, Dylan toured the US and Canada for six months, backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as [[The Band]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 82–94</ref> While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences, their studio efforts floundered. Producer [[Bob Johnston]] persuaded Dylan to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in February 1966, and surrounded him with top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 238–243.</ref> The Nashville sessions produced the double album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966), featuring what Dylan called "that thin wild mercury sound".<ref>"The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the ''Blonde on Blonde'' album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." Dylan Interview, ''Playboy'', March 1978; reprinted in Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 204.</ref> Kooper described it as "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.<ref>Gill, p. 95.</ref>

On November 22, 1965, Dylan secretly married 25-year-old former model [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]].<ref name = "Sounes-p193">Sounes, p. 193.</ref> Some of Dylan's friends, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.<ref name = "Sounes-p193"/> Journalist [[Nora Ephron]] made the news public in the ''[[New York Post]]'' in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed."<ref>Shelton, p. 325.</ref>

Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and harmonica. In the second, backed by [[The Band#Early years: The Hawks|the Hawks]], he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and [[Slow clap|slow handclapped]].<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 244–261.</ref> The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in England on May 17, 1966.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nme.com/reviews/bob-dylan/199| title = Live 1966| date = September 6, 1998| accessdate =May 2, 2010|work=NME |location=UK }}</ref> A recording of this concert was released in 1998: ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]''. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" to which Dylan responded, "I don't believe you&nbsp;... You're a liar!" Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"<ref>Dylan's dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Martin Scorsese's documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]''</ref> as they launched into the final song of the night—"Like a Rolling Stone".

During his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting "as if on a death trip".<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 251.</ref> [[D. A. Pennebaker]], the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else."<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 250.</ref> In a 1969 interview with [[Jann Wenner]], Dylan said, "I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things&nbsp;... just to keep going, you know?"<ref>''Rolling Stone'', November 29, 1969. Reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 140.</ref> In 2011, [[BBC Radio 4]] reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: "I got very, very strung out for a while&nbsp;... I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9492000/9492886.stm| title = Dylan tapes reveal heroin addiction| author=Jones, Rebecca| date = May 23, 2011| accessdate =May 26, 2011| publisher=BBC Radio 4}}</ref> Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had "been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career."<ref>{{cite web

====Motorcycle accident and reclusion====
After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] had paid an advance for a TV show.<ref>Sounes, p. 215.</ref> His publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel ''[[Tarantula (book)|Tarantula]].'' Manager [[Albert Grossman]] had scheduled a concert tour for that summer and fall.

On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc [[Triumph Tiger 100]] motorcycle near his home in [[Woodstock, New York]] and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several [[vertebrae]] in his neck.<ref name = "Sounes-217">Sounes, pp. 217–219.</ref> Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.<ref name = "Sounes-217"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061106200746/http://www.americanheritage.com/email/articles/web/20060729-bob-dylan-motorcycle-woodstock-methamphetamine-robert-shelton-howard-sounes-ed-thaler.shtml|title=The Bob Dylan Motorcycle-Crash Mystery|author = Scherman, Tony|date=July 29, 2006|accessdate=June 18, 2014|publisher=American Heritage}}</ref> Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him.<ref name = "Sounes-217"/><ref name="shades268">Heylin (2000), p. 268.</ref> Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race."<ref>Dylan, p. 114.</ref> Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 143.</ref>

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] and rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.<ref>Sounes, p. 216.</ref> The film was subsequently titled ''[[Eat the Document]]'' on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals.<ref>Lee, pp. 39–63.</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233629/| title = ''Eat the Document'' on IMDb| accessdate = September 27, 2013| publisher = imdb.com}}</ref> In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, "Big Pink".<ref>Sounes, pp. 222–225.</ref> These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for [[Julie Driscoll]] and [[The Brian Auger Trinity]] ("[[This Wheel's on Fire (song)|This Wheel's on Fire]]"), [[The Byrds]] ("[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]", "Nothing Was Delivered"), and [[Manfred Mann]] ("[[Quinn the Eskimo (Mighty Quinn)|Mighty Quinn]]"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''. Over the years, more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on [[bootleg recording]]s, culminating in a five-CD set titled ''The Genuine Basement Tapes'', containing [[List of Basement Tapes songs|107 songs and alternative takes]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 236–265.</ref> In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' using songs they worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves [[The Band]],<ref>Helm, Levon and Davis, ''This Wheel's on Fire'', p. 164; p. 174.</ref> beginning a long recording and performing career of their own.

In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref name = "BjornerJWH">{{cite web| title = Columbia Studio A, Nashville, Tennessee, John Wesley Harding sessions| url = http://www.bjorner.com/DSN01620%201967.htm#DSN01640| accessdate =November 10, 2008| publisher=Bjorner's Still On the Road}}</ref> Back in the studio after a 19 months, he was accompanied by [[Charlie McCoy]] on bass,<ref name = "BjornerJWH"/> [[Kenny Buttrey]] on drums,<ref name = "BjornerJWH"/> and [[Pete Drake]] on steel guitar.<ref name = "BjornerJWH"/> The result was ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'', a contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on the [[American West]] and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition seriously, departed from Dylan's own work and from the psychedelic fervor of the 1960s.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 282–288.</ref> It included "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", with lyrics derived from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (21:5–9).

Dylan's next release, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), was mainstream country featuring Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and the hit single "[[Lay Lady Lay]]".<ref>Gill, p. 140.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range."<ref>Shelton (2011), p. 273.</ref> Dylan and Cash also recorded a series of duets, but only their recording of Dylan's "[[Girl from the North Country]]" was used on the album.

In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of [[Johnny Cash]]'s television show, duetting with Cash on "[[Girl from the North Country]]", "I Threw It All Away", and "Living the Blues". Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the [[Isle of Wight]] festival on August 31, 1969, after the [[Woodstock Festival]] closer to his home.<ref>Sounes, pp. 248–253.</ref>

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. ''Rolling Stone'' writer [[Greil Marcus]] asked "What is this shit?" on first listening to ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'', released in June 1970.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/15/bob-dylan-writings-marcus-review| title = Bob Dylan: Writings 1968–2010 by Greil Marcus| author = Ford, Mark| date = May 14, 2011| accessdate = August 20, 2011| publisher = guardian.co.uk| location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/11/bob_dylan.html | title = Bob Dylan—Disc of the Day: ''Self Portrait'' | last = Male | first = Andrew | date = November 26, 2007 | accessdate =September 24, 2008 | publisher=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}</ref> ''Self Portrait'', a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Bob+Dylan| title = Self Portrait| author=Christgau, Robert| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=robertchristgau.com}}</ref> In October 1970, Dylan released ''[[New Morning]]'', considered a return to form.<ref>Shelton, p. 482.</ref> In November 1968, Dylan had co-written "[[I'd Have You Anytime]]" with [[George Harrison]];<ref>Heylin (2009), pp. 391–392.</ref> Harrison recorded "I'd Have You Anytime" and Dylan's "[[If Not for You]]" for his 1970 solo triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''. Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 ''[[Concert for Bangladesh]]'' attracted media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 328–331.</ref>

Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in [[Greenwich Village]]. These sessions resulted in "[[Watching the River Flow]]" and a new recording of "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 128.</ref> On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded "[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]]'s death in [[San Quentin prison]] that year.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 342–343.</ref> Dylan contributed piano and harmony to [[Steve Goodman]]'s album, ''Somebody Else's Troubles'', under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas in September 1972.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 267.</ref>

In 1972, Dylan signed to [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', providing [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)|songs and backing music]] for the movie, and playing "Alias", a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis.<ref> C. P. Lee wrote: "In Garrett's ghost-written memoir, ''[[The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid]]'', published within a year of Billy's death, he wrote that 'Billy's partner doubtless had a name which was his legal property, but he was so given to changing it that it is impossible to fix on the right one. Billy always called him Alias.{{'"}} Lee, pp. 66–67.</ref> Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door (song)|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" became one of Dylan's most covered songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Björner|first=Olof|title=Dylan covers sorted by song name: k|url=http://www.bjorner.com/songsk.htm|publisher=bjorner.com|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>Artists to have covered the song include [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Guns N' Roses]]. {{cite web | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11376880 | title = Dylan's Legacy Keeps Growing, Cover By Cover | date = June 26, 2007 | accessdate =October 1, 2008 | publisher=[[NPR Music]]}}</ref>

Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]], when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, ''[[Planet Waves]]'', he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of "Forever Young", which became one of his most popular songs.<ref name = "Sounes-p273">Sounes, pp. 273–274.</ref> As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan",<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 354.</ref> and Dylan himself commented: "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental."<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>

Columbia Records simultaneously released ''[[Dylan (1973 album)|Dylan]]'', a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 358.</ref> In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|North American tour]]of 40 concerts. A live double album, ''[[Before the Flood]]'', was on Asylum Records. Soon, Columbia Records said word they "will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold".<ref name = "Shelton-378">Shelton, p. 37.</ref> Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of ''Planet Waves''.<ref name = "Shelton-378"/> Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.

 |description= Dylan said of the opening song from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'': "I was trying to deal with the concept of time, and the way the characters change from the first person to the third person, and you're never sure if the first person is talking or the third person.

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' in September 1974.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 368–383.</ref> Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at [[Sound 80]] Studios in [[Minneapolis]] with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 369–387.</ref>

Released in early 1975, ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' received mixed reviews.

In [[Salon.com]], [[Bill Wyman]] wrote: "''Blood on the Tracks'' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."<ref>{{cite news | title = Bob Dylan | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date = May 5, 2001 | url = http://www.salon.com/2001/05/22/dylan_3/ | accessdate =September 7, 2008 }}</ref> Novelist [[Rick Moody]] called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape."<ref>Hedin, p. 109.</ref>

That summer Dylan wrote a ballad championing boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]], imprisoned for a triple murder in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], New Jersey, in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "[[Hurricane (song)|Hurricane]]", presenting the case for Carter's innocence.

In 1978, Dylan embarked on a [[1978 Tour|year-long world tour]], performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million.

In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same band and vocalists into Rundown Studios in [[Santa Monica]], California, to record an album of new material: ''[[Street-Legal (album)|Street-Legal]]''.<ref>Heylin (2011), pp. 479–481.</ref> It was described by Michael Gray as, "after ''Blood On The Tracks'', arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life".<ref>Gray (2006), p. 643.</ref> However, it had poor sound and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 480–481.</ref>

''[[Slow Train Coming]]'' (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of [[Mark Knopfler]] (of [[Dire Straits]]) and was produced by [[R&B]] producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. Wexler said Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: "Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album."<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 501–503.</ref> The album won a [[Grammy Award]] as "Best Male Vocalist" for the song "[[Gotta Serve Somebody]]".

===1980s===
[[File:Bob Dylan in Toronto2.jpg|thumb|alt=Dylan, onstage and with eyes closed, plays a chord on an electric guitar.|Dylan in Toronto April 18, 1980]]
In late 1980 Dylan briefly played concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. ''[[Shot of Love]]'', recorded next spring, featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs. "[[Every Grain of Sand (Bob Dylan song)|Every Grain of Sand]]" reminded some of [[William Blake]]'s verses.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 215–221.</ref>

In the 1980s reception of Dylan's recordings varied, from the well-regarded ''[[Infidels]]'' in 1983 to the panned ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in 1988. Michael Gray condemned Dylan's 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<ref>Gray (2000), pp. 11–14.</ref> As an example of the latter, the ''Infidels'' recording sessions, which again employed Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were "[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]", a tribute to the [[Blind Willie McTell|dead blues musician]] and an evocation of [[African American history]],<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 56–59.</ref> "Foot of Pride" and "[[Lord Protect My Child]]". These three songs were released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991]]''.<ref>Sounes, pp. 354–356.</ref>

Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''.<ref name = Sounes362>Sounes, p. 362.</ref> [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], who had remixed hits for [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]], was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound "a little bit more contemporary".<ref name = Sounes362/>

Dylan sang on [[USA for Africa]]'s famine relief single "[[We Are the World]]". On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], Philadelphia. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]], he performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and said: "I hope that some of the money&nbsp;... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe&nbsp;... one or two million, maybe&nbsp;... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks."<ref>Sounes, p. 367.</ref> His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire [[Willie Nelson]] to organize a series of events, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.<ref>Sounes, pp. 365–367.</ref>

In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into [[rap music]] when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock", featured on [[Kurtis Blow]]'s album ''Kingdom Blow''.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 63</ref> Dylan's next studio album, ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'', in July 1986 contained three covers (by Little [[Junior Parker]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and the gospel hymn "[[Precious Memories (hymn)|Precious Memories]]"), plus three collaborations with ([[Tom Petty]], [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating."<ref>{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6448|pure_url=yes}}| title = Knocked Out Loaded| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=allmusic}}</ref> It was the first Dylan album since ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Freewheelin']]'' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 595.</ref> Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, "[[Brownsville Girl]]", a work of genius.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 95–100.</ref>

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]] in 1987, resulting in a live album ''[[Dylan & The Dead]]''. This received negative reviews: ''[[Allmusic]]'' said, "Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead."<ref>{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r54428|pure_url=yes}}

E. Smith]]. Dylan continued to tour with a small, evolving band for the next 20 years.<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 297–299.</ref>

[[File:Bob Dylan Barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Dylan plays his guitar and sings into a microphone onstage.|Dylan in [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], Spain, 1984]]
In 1987, Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]'s movie ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'', in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover, ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]), leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by [[Rupert Everett]].<ref>Sounes, pp. 376–383.</ref> Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—"Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of [[John Hiatt]]'s "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 599–604.</ref>
Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.<ref>Speech on Bob Dylan's induction to the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, January 20, 1988, reprinted in Bauldie, pp. 191–193.</ref>

The album ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album.<ref name = "Sounes 385">Sounes, p. 385.</ref> Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13">Gray (2000), p. 13.</ref> The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. Dylan co-founded the band with [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Tom Petty]], and in late 1988 their multi-platinum ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' reached three on the US album chart,<ref name = "Sounes 385"/> featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 627–628.</ref> Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 638–640.</ref>

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13"/><ref>Dylan, pp. 145–221.</ref> The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'', while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, pp. 413–20.</ref> The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.<ref>Scott Marshall wrote: "When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods. For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God." Marshall, ''Restless Pilgrim'', p. 103.</ref>

===1990s===
Dylan's 1990s began with ''[[Under the Red Sky]]'' (1990), an about-face from the serious ''Oh Mercy''. The album contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [[Carolyn Dennis]], Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 174.</ref> [[Sidemen]] on the album included George Harrison, [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] from [[Guns N' Roses]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Elton John]]. Despite the line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.<ref>Sounes, p. 391.</ref>

In 1991, Dylan received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] from American actor [[Jack Nicholson]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards| title = Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award| accessdate =September 25, 2008| publisher=Grammy.com}}</ref> The event coincided with the start of the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]], and Dylan performed "[[Masters of War]]". Dylan then made a short speech, saying "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'"<ref name = "Heylin-664">Heylin (2000), pp. 664–665.</ref> This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].<ref>Bell, 2012, ''Once Upon a Time: The Lives of Bob Dylan.'', p. 101.</ref>

The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering folk and blues numbers: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",<ref>Gray (2006), p. 423.</ref> written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on hits.<ref>Sounes, pp. 408–409.</ref> The album from it, ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'', included "John Brown", an unreleased 1963 song of war and [[jingoism]].
[[File:B dylan 1996.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dylan and members of his band perform onstage. Dylan, wearing a red shirt and black pants, plays an electric guitar and sings.|Dylan performs at a 1996 concert in [[Stockholm]]]]

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch,<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 693.</ref> Dylan booked recording time with [[Daniel Lanois]] at [[Miami]]'s [[Criteria Studios]] in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 697.</ref> Late that spring, before the album's release, Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, [[pericarditis]], brought on by [[histoplasmosis]]. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] soon."<ref>Sounes, p. 420.</ref> He was back on the road by midsummer, and performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric "Blowin' in the Wind".<ref>Sounes, p. 426.</ref>

September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, ''[[Time Out of Mind]]''. With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed.

In December 1997, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dylan with a [[Kennedy Center]] Honor in the East Room of the [[White House]], paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/WH/New/html/19971208-2814.html

In 1999, Dylan embarked on a North American tour with [[Paul Simon]], where each alternated as headline act with a "middle" section where they performed together, starting on the first of June and ending September 18. The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy, from the ''Berkshire Eagle'', questioning the collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshireweb.com/rogovoy/interviews/dylan716.html |title=Bob Dylan and Paul Simon: A mismatch made in heaven? by Seth Rogovoy |publisher=Berkshireweb.com |accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>

In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his "born again" period and participated in the CD project ''[[Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan]]''.

Among those quoting Dylan were [[US Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice John Roberts]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], both conservatives.

====''Together Through Life'' and ''Christmas in the Heart''====
Bob Dylan released his album ''[[Together Through Life]]'' on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director [[Olivier Dahan]] asked him to supply a song for his new [[road movie]], ''[[My Own Love Song]]''; initially only intending to record a single track, "Life Is Hard," "the record sort of took its own direction".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bobdylan.com/conversation| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110425235613/http://www.bobdylan.com/conversation| archivedate = 2011-04-25| title = Bob Dylan talks about the new album with Bill Flanagan| author=Flanagan, Bill| date = April 10, 2009| accessdate =March 30, 2012| publisher=bobdylan.com}}</ref> Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].<ref>{{cite web

Andy Gill wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the record "features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar.

Dylan's performances in [[People's Republic of China|China]] in April 2011 generated controversy.

In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery, London, hosted an exhibition of seven wrought iron gates that Dylan had created. The exhibition was titled ''Mood Swings''. In a statement released by the gallery, Dylan said: "I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.artlyst.com/articles/the-legendary-bob-dylan-unveils-seven-iron-gates-sculpture| title = The Legendary Bob Dylan Unveils Seven Iron Gates Sculpture| date = September 24, 2013| accessdate = November 16, 2013

===Religious beliefs===
Growing up in [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].<ref>According to Robert Shelton, Dylan's teacher was "Rabbi Reuben Maier of the only synagogue on the [[Iron Range]], Hibbing's Agudath Achim Synagogue".

[[File:Bob Dylan 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Dylan performing onstage with an electric guitar.|Dylan performs in [[Ahoy Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, June 4, 1984]]

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dylan converted to Christianity. From January to April 1979, he participated in Bible study classes at the [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard School of Discipleship]] in [[Reseda, California|Reseda]], California. Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord."<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 494.</ref><ref>Gray (2006), pp. 76–80.</ref>

By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the "[[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]" label. He told [[Kurt Loder]] of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: "I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come." In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, "Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind."<ref>''Rolling Stone'', June 21, 1984, reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 288.</ref> In 1997 he told [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'':
{{cquote|Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else.

In an interview published in ''The New York Times'' on September 28, 1997, journalist [[Jon Pareles]] reported that "Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/arts/pop-jazz-a-wiser-voice-blowin-in-the-autumn-wind.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=A Wiser Voice Blowin' In the Autumn Wind|first=Jon|last=Pareles|work=The New York Times |date=September 28, 1997|accessdate=May 12, 2010}} Reprinted in Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', pp. 391–396.</ref>

Dylan has been a supporter of the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] movement in the last 20 years,<ref>Fishkoff, p. 167.</ref> and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the [[Bar Mitzvah]]s of his sons and attending [[Hadar Hatorah]], a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[yeshiva]]. In September 1989 and September 1991, he appeared on the Chabad [[telethon]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 317, 343.</ref> Dylan reportedly visits [[Chabad|Chabad synagogues]]; on [[Yom Kippur]] in 2007 he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he was called to the [[Torah]] for the sixth [[Baal kore|aliyah]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Arutz| last=Sheva | title = Day of Atonement Draws Dylan to the Torah | publisher=Arutz Sheva—Israel National News | date = September 24, 2007 | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/133709| accessdate =September 11, 2008}}</ref>

Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has also made passing references to his religious faith—such as in a 2004 interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', when he told [[Ed Bradley]] that "the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God." He also explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the "chief commander—in this earth and in the world we can't see."<ref name = "60minutes2005">{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/12/02/60minutes/main658799.shtml%20"| title = Dylan Looks Back| author = Leung, Rebecca| date = June 12, 2005| accessdate = February 25, 2009| publisher = CBS News}}</ref>

In a 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan promoting Dylan's Christmas LP, ''[[Christmas in the Heart]]'', Flanagan commented on the "heroic performance" Dylan gave of "[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]" and that he "delivered the song like a true believer". Dylan replied: "Well, I am a true believer."<ref name = "Dylan 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan">{{cite web| url = http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=30857&bPrint=1| title = Bob Dylan gives interview to The Big Issue| author=Flanagan, Bill (interviewer)| date = November 28, 2009| accessdate =March 26, 2010| publisher=music-news.com}}</ref>

When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex. For many critics, his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums—''Bringing It All Back Home'', ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''. In [[Mike Marqusee]]'s words:
<blockquote>
Between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, [[Symbolist poetry|symbolist]], [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist]] and [[Beat poetry]], [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine|''Mad'' magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console."<ref name="Marqusee139">Marqusee, p. 139.</ref></blockquote>

Dylan's work began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets in regard to his lyrics. Literary critic [[Christopher Ricks]] published a 500-page analysis of Dylan's work, placing him in the context of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Ricks|title=Dylan's Visions of Sin|publisher=Penguin/Viking|year=2003|isbn=0-670-80133-X}}</ref> claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close analysis.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jul/13/academicexperts.highereducationprofile | title = Ricks profile: Someone's gotta hold of his art | author=MacLeod, Donald | date = July 13, 2004 | accessdate =September 7, 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> Former British [[poet laureate]] Sir [[Andrew Motion]] argued that his lyrics should be studied in schools.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/poetry/article2503109.ece| title = Andrew Motion explains why Bob Dylan's lyrics should be studied in schools | author=Motion, Andrew| date = September 22, 2007| accessdate =October 10, 2008| work=The Times | location=London}}</ref> Since 1996, academics have lobbied the [[Swedish Academy]] to award Dylan the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.expectingrain.com/dok/art/nobel/nobelpress.html | title = Finally and Formally Launched as a Candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, 1997 |accessdate=September 7, 2008| publisher=expectingrain.com | date = May 24, 2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ball|first=Gordon| url = http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/22i/Ball.pdf |format=PDF| title = Dylan and the Nobel| accessdate =September 7, 2008 | work=[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]] | date = March 7, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/06/entertainment/main647862.shtml | title = Dylan's Words Strike Nobel Debate | accessdate =September 7, 2008 | publisher=CBS News | date = October 6, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/19/bob-dylan-nobel-odds-rise-literature| title = Bob Dylan's Nobel odds rise, but not his chances| author = Flood, Alison| date = September 19, 2012| accessdate = September 20, 2012| publisher = ''The Guardian''| location=London}}</ref>

Dylan's voice also received critical attention. ''New York Times'' critic Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk|Dave Van Ronk's]]."<ref>Shelton, pp. 108–111.</ref> [[David Bowie]], in his tribute, "[[Song for Bob Dylan]]", described Dylan's singing as "a voice like sand and glue". His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on "Like a Rolling Stone" as "at once young and jeeringly cynical".<ref>Gray (2006), p. 413.</ref> As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal ''[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]]'', "Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in "Everything is Broken" (on the album ''[[Oh Mercy]]'') is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/22i/lebold| title = A Face like a Mask and a Voice that Croaks: An Integrated Poetics of Bob Dylan's Voice, Personae, and Lyrics | author=Lebold, Christophe| date = March 1, 2007| accessdate =May 3, 2010| work=Oral Tradition }}</ref>

Dylan's oeuvre has influenced several musical genres. As [[Edna Gundersen]] stated in ''USA Today'': "Dylan's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/2001-05-18-35-years-of-dylan.htm| title = Forever Dylan | date = May 17, 2001 | accessdate =September 9, 2014| last = Gundersen | first = Edna |work=USA Today }}</ref> Punk musician [[Joe Strummer]] praised Dylan for having "laid down the template for lyric, tune, seriousness, spirituality, depth of rock music."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/1349116.stm| title = Bob Dylan: His Legacy to Music| date = May 29, 2001| accessdate =October 5, 2008|publisher=BBC News }}</ref> Other major musicians who acknowledged Dylan's importance were [[John Lennon]],<ref>Lennon: "In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all.

Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book ''Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom'', [[Nik Cohn]] objected: "I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype."<ref>Cohn, pp. 164–165.</ref> Australian critic [[Jack Marx]] credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: "What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from [[Mick Jagger]] to [[Eminem]] educating themselves from the Dylan handbook."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/tangled-up-in-blah/story-e6frg8px-1111117308423 | title = Tangled Up In Blah | author=Marx, Jack | date = September 2, 2008 | accessdate =October 5, 2008 | work=The Australian }}</ref>

Fellow musicians also presented dissenting views. [[Joni Mitchell]] described Dylan as a "plagiarist" and his voice as "fake" in a 2010 interview in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both created personas.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/22/entertainment/la-et-jonimitchell-20100422/2| title = It's a Joni Mitchell concert| author=Diehl, Matt| date = April 22, 2010| accessdate =May 2, 2010| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Bethany|last=Larson| title=Folk Face-Off: Joni Mitchell vs. Bob Dylan | url=http://flavorwire.com/85781/folk-face-off-joni-mitchell-vs-bob-dylan|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=August 4, 2011|publisher=Flavorwire.com}}</ref> Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/04/30/is-bob-dylan-a-phony.html | title = Is Bob Dylan a Phony?| author=Wilentz, Sean| authorlink = Sean Wilentz | date = April 30, 2010| accessdate =May 2, 2010| work=The Daily Beast}}</ref> In 2013 Mitchell told the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)]] in an interview that her remarks in the ''Los Angeles Times'' had been taken "completely out of context", and that the interviewer was a "moron". Mitchell added: "I like a lot of Bob's songs. Musically he's not very gifted. He's borrowed his voice from old hillbillies. He's got a lot of borrowed things. He's not a great guitar player.

Talking to [[Mikal Gilmore]] in ''Rolling Stone'' in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of [[Henry Timrod|Henry Timrod's]] verse in his album ''Modern Times'',<ref name = "nytTimrod"/> by saying that it was "part of the tradition".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-unleashed-a-wild-ride-on-his-new-lp-and-striking-back-at-critics-20120927?page=7| title = Bob Dylan Unleashed| author = Gilmore, Mikal| date = September 27, 2012| accessdate = January 11, 2013| publisher = rollingstone.com}}</ref><ref group=a>Dylan told Gilmore: "As far as Henry Timrod is concerned, have you even heard of him?

Wussies and pussies complain about that stuff. It's an old thing – it's part of the tradition."</ref>

If Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,<ref name="Marqusee139"/> critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. Following the release of [[Todd Haynes|Todd Haynes']] Dylan biopic ''[[I'm Not There]]'', [[J. Hoberman]] wrote in his 2007 ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' review:

<blockquote>Elvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-11-13/film/like-a-complete-unknown-i-m-not-there-and-the-changing-face-of-bob-dylan-on-film/| title = Like A Complete Unknown| author=Hoberman, J. | date = November 20, 2007| accessdate =October 5, 2008| work=The Village Voice }}</ref></blockquote>

Prior to the June 2014 sale of the original lyrics of "Like a Rolling Stone", written on four sheets of hotel stationery by Dylan in 1965, Richard Austin, of [[Sotheby's]], New York, said: "Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less. By defying convention with six and a half minutes of dark, brooding poetry, Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music."<ref name="Sale" /><ref name = "nyt">{{cite news| url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/handwritten-manuscripts-for-dylans-like-a-rolling-stone-to-be-auctioned/ | title = Dylan's Handwritten Lyrics to 'Like a Rolling Stone' to Be Auctioned| author = Kozinn, Alan| date = April 30, 2014| accessdate = April 30, 2014| work = The New York Times}}</ref>
