In the US, acupuncture is increasingly ({{As of|2014|lc=y}}) used at [[academic medical centers]]

=== Pseudoscience ===

{{efn|name=SinghErnst2008}}&lt;ref name="Ahn2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann2000&gt;{{cite book | last = Mann | first = F | author-link = Felix Mann | isbn = 978-0750648578 | publisher = [[Elsevier Health Sciences|Elsevier]] | year = 2000 | title = Reinventing Acupuncture: A New Concept of Ancient Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editorial described TCM as "fraught with pseudoscience"

=== ''De-qi'' sensation ===

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=&#24471;&#27668;|p=d&#233; q&#236;}}; "arrival of qi") refers to a claimed sensation of numbness

Other techniques aim at "tonifying" ({{zh|s=&#34917;|p=b&#468;}}) or "sedating" ({{zh|s=&#27844;|p=xi&#232;}}) ''qi''.&lt;ref name="AungChen2007"/&gt; The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Eight principles of diagnosis|deficiency]] patterns

=== Efficacy ===
{{asof|2021}} many thousands of papers had been published

=== Needles ===
Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|and|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Aung116&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA116 116].&lt;/ref&gt; with thicker needles used on more robust patients.

Acupuncture is a substantial part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM).

==== Neolithic ====

Acupuncture may have been practised during the [[Neolithic]] era, near the end of the [[Stone Age]], using sharpened stones called [[Bian Stones|Bian shi]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called "plen", which means "stone probe", that may have been used for acupuncture purposes.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}}

====Establishment and growth====
In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140&#8211;41}} The 'science of the yin-yang cycles' ({{lang|zh|&#36939;&#27683;&#23416;}} {{transliteration|zh|y&#249;n q&#236; xu&#233;}}{{efn|A reference to the five movements and six ''qi'' ({{lang|zh|&#20116;&#36939;&#20845;&#27683;}} {{transliteration|zh|w&#468; y&#249;n li&#249; q&#236;}}).}}) was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (''tian'') and earthly (''di'') forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140&#8211;41}} There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140&#8211;41}} According to Needham and Lu, these "arbitrary predictions" were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

==Dish-bearers==

The chief attendants at Anglo-Saxon royal feasts were dish-bearers and [[butler]]s or cup-bearers. Dish-bearer in [[Medieval Latin]] (ML) is {{lang|la|discifer}} or {{lang|la|dapifer}}, and in [[Old English]] (OE) {{lang|ang|discþegn}}, also {{lang|ang|discðegn}} and {{lang|ang|discþen}} (dish-[[thegn]]).{{sfnm|1a1=Gautier|1y=2017|1pp=269, 273–274|2a1=Keynes|2y=2014|2p=460}} The French medievalist Alban Gautier states: "Both {{lang|la|discifer}} and {{lang|la|dapifer}} literally mean {{gloss|dish-bearer}}, but in the first case {{gloss|dish}} should be understood as the disc-shaped object ({{lang|la|discus}}), whereas in the second it refers to the culinary preparation that was inside ({{lang|la|dapes}})."{{sfn|Gautier|2017|p=274}}

==== Gregory of Nyssa ====
[[Gregory of Nyssa]] wrote:<blockquote>Scripture informs us that the Deity '''proceeded by a sort of graduated and ordered advance to the creation of man'''. After the foundations of the universe were laid, as the history records, man did not appear on the earth at once, but the creation of the brutes preceded him, and the plants preceded them. Thereby Scripture shows that the vital forces blended with the world of matter according to a gradation; first it infused itself into insensate nature; and in continuation of this advanced into the sentient world; and then ascended to intelligent and rational beings (emphasis added).<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] wrote in his work on the history of evolutionary thought,

== Christopher C. Kraft Jr ==

On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 went into orbit around the Moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two men sat together in Mission Control, reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.

{{Blockquote  | It was glorious pandemonium, and through the mist in my own eyes, I saw Bob Gilruth wiping at his and hoping that no one saw him crying. I put my hand on his arm and squeezed. [...] He lifted my hand from his arm and shook it strongly. There were no words from either of us. The lumps in our throats held them back.<ref>Kraft, ''Flight'', p. 299.</ref>}}

Kraft again found himself a spectator during the landing of [[Apollo 11]], which he viewed from Mission Control, sitting with Gilruth and George Low.<ref>Kraft, ''Flight'', p. 316</ref> He played a more active role in events during the unfolding of the [[Apollo 13]] crisis. Called into Mission Control by Gene Kranz almost immediately after the accident,<ref>Kranz, ''Failure is Not an Option'', p. 313</ref> he led discussions on whether Apollo 13 should attempt a direct abort, or go around the Moon and return on a free trajectory; the latter option was taken.<ref>Kranz, ''Failure is Not an Option'', pp. 316–318</ref>
