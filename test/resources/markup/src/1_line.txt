The '''1{{nbsp}}Line''', formerly '''Central Link''', is a [[light rail]] line in [[Seattle]], Washington, United States, and part of [[Sound Transit]]'s [[Link light rail]] system. It serves 19 stations in the cities of Seattle, [[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]], and [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]], traveling nearly {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} between {{stn|Northgate||Sound Transit}} and {{stn|Angle Lake}} stations. The line connects the [[University District, Seattle|University District]], [[Downtown Seattle]], the [[Rainier Valley, Seattle|Rainier Valley]], and [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]]. The 1{{nbsp}}Line carried over 26&nbsp;million total passengers in 2023, with an average of nearly 80,000 daily passengers on weekdays. It runs for 20 hours per day on weekdays and Saturdays, with [[headway]]s of up to six minutes during [[peak hour]]s, and reduced 18-hour service on Sundays and holidays.

Trains are composed of two or more cars that each can carry 194 passengers, including 74 in seats, along with wheelchairs and bicycles. Fares are calculated based on distance traveled and are paid through the regional [[ORCA card]], paper tickets, or a mobile app. Sound Transit uses [[proof-of-payment]] to verify passenger fares, employing fare ambassadors and [[transit police]] to conduct random inspections. All stations have [[ticket vending machine]]s, [[public art]], bicycle parking, and bus connections, while several also have [[park-and-ride]] lots.

Voters approved Central Link in a 1996 ballot measure and construction began in 2003, after the project was reorganized under a new budget and truncated route in response to higher than expected costs. The light rail line, which followed decades of failed transit plans for the Seattle region, opened on July 18, 2009, terminating at {{stn|Westlake||Sound Transit}} in the [[Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel]] and {{stn|Tukwila International Boulevard}} near Sea–Tac Airport. It was extended south to {{stn|SeaTac/Airport}} in December 2009, north to the University of Washington in March 2016, and south to Angle Lake in September 2016. The line was temporarily renamed the Red Line until its designation was changed to the 1{{nbsp}}Line in 2021, coinciding with an extension to Northgate.

Further extensions to [[Lynnwood Transit Center|Lynnwood]] and [[Federal Way Transit Center|Federal Way]] are planned to open in 2024 and 2026, respectively. The [[2 Line (Sound Transit)|2&nbsp;Line]], connecting Seattle to the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] suburbs, will form a multi-line network via its connection with the 1{{nbsp}}Line in 2025. Further expansion under [[Sound Transit 3]] will divide the current corridor between two lines, the 1{{nbsp}}Line from [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]] to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and the [[3 Line (Sound Transit)|3&nbsp;Line]] from [[Everett, Washington|Everett]] to [[West Seattle, Seattle|West Seattle]].

===Background and early transit proposals===

Public transit service within Seattle began in 1884, with the introduction of the city's first horse-drawn [[streetcar]] line. The system had been replaced with a network of electric streetcars and [[Cable car (railway)|cable cars]] by the end of the decade, which spurred the development of new [[streetcar suburbs]] across modern-day Seattle.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 1, 1987 |title=A look into rail's past |page=B3 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}</ref><ref name="HL-Streetcars">{{cite web |last=Crowley |first=Walt |author-link=Walt Crowley |date=October 2, 2000 |title=Street Railways in Seattle |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/2707 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918154346/http://www.historylink.org/File/2707 |archive-date=September 18, 2017 |access-date=September 17, 2017 |work=[[HistoryLink]]}}</ref> Interurban railways to [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], and the [[Rainier Valley, Seattle|Rainier Valley]] were established after the turn of the century, giving the region an intercity passenger rail system to feed the streetcar lines.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dorpat |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Dorpat |date=November 6, 1983 |title=Plush as a Parlor: Some Interurban commuters paid more for a cushy ride |page=6 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> The interurban system failed to compete with the increasing popularity of automobile travel, capped by the completion of [[U.S. Route 99]] in the late 1920s, and was shut down.<ref>{{cite web |last=Crowley |first=Walt |date=September 19, 2000 |title=Interurban Rail Transit in King County and the Puget Sound Region |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/2667 |access-date=March 24, 2018 |work=HistoryLink}}</ref> By 1941, the streetcars had also been acquired by the municipal government and replaced with a [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|trolleybus network]].<ref name="HL-Streetcars"/><ref>{{cite news |date=December 10, 2007 |title=Seattle's streetcar history |page=A6 |work=The Seattle Times |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20071210&slug=streetcartimeline10 |url-status=live |access-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918154625/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20071210&slug=streetcartimeline10 |archive-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref>

Various proposals for a [[rapid transit]] system in Seattle, to replace the streetcar—and later bus—networks, were presented in the 20th century and rejected by city officials or voters due to their cost or other factors. In 1911, urban planner [[Virgil Bogue]] proposed a {{convert|41|mi|km|adj=mid}} system of subway tunnels and elevated railways as the centerpiece to a [[comprehensive plan]] for the city, which was rejected by voters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sipe |first=Tyler |date=March 5, 2017 |title=Off track: Seattle rejects first mass transit ballot measure on March 5, 1912 |work=The Seattle Times |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/off-track-seattle-rejects-first-rapid-rail-network-measure-on-march-5-1912/ |url-status=live |url-access=limited |access-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918110620/http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/off-track-seattle-rejects-first-rapid-rail-network-measure-on-march-5-1912/ |archive-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref> The [[Seattle Center Monorail]], originally built for the [[Century 21 Exposition|1962 World's Fair]], has been the subject of several unsuccessful expansion proposals backed by Governor [[Albert Rosellini]] in the 1960s and Seattle voters in the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lindblom |first=Mike |date=July 30, 2002 |title=Another '60s revival: running a monorail along Interstate 5 |page=A1 |work=The Seattle Times |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020730&slug=freewayrail30m0 |access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref> The [[Forward Thrust]] Committee of the late 1960s proposed a {{convert|47|mi|km|adj=mid}} rapid transit system, to connect Downtown Seattle to [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]], the [[University District, Seattle|University District]], [[Lake City, Seattle|Lake City]], [[Capitol Hill, Seattle|Capitol Hill]], [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], and [[Renton, Washington|Renton]].

===Light rail planning===

Following the failed Forward Thrust initiatives, [[Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle|Metro Transit]] was created in 1972 to oversee a countywide bus network, and plan for a future rail system.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Bob |date=March 20, 1975 |title=Metro program looks to future |page=H7 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> In the early 1980s, Metro Transit and the [[Puget Sound Council of Governments]] (PSCOG) explored [[light rail]] and [[Bus rapid transit|busway]] concepts to serve the region,<ref>{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Bob |date=March 22, 1981 |title='Light rail' system might solve transit problems, says study |page=A16 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> ultimately choosing to build a [[Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel|downtown transit tunnel]] that would be convertible from buses to light rail at a later date.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Bob |date=April 22, 1988 |title=Metro makes tracks for tracks for future |page=B1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> The PSCOG formally endorsed a light rail plan in 1986, recommending a system be built by 2020, and include a line between Seattle and [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport|Sea-Tac Airport]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matassa Flores |first1=Michele |last2=Parrish |first2=W.Y. |last3=Shatzkin |first3=Kate |date=September 13, 1989 |title=Cities' influence takes off: Expanded roles with more clout for Sea-Tac and Federal Way |page=F1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> with routing alternatives that served the Rainier Valley.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bergsman |first=Jerry |date=July 9, 1986 |title=Panel's advice: Plan now for rail |page=H1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Central Link Light Rail Transit Project Final Environmental Impact Statement |date=October 22, 1999 |publisher=Sound Transit |page=G-36 |chapter=Appendix G: Environmental Justice Technical Report |oclc=42730086 |access-date=January 3, 2018 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCQ3AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA36 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119063248/https://books.google.com/books?id=TCQ3AQAAMAAJ&lpg=RA1-PA36&ots=9P8ORpYdTo&pg=RA1-PA36 |archive-date=January 19, 2018 |url-status=live |via=Google Books}}</ref> A 1988 advisory measure on light rail planning was passed in [[King County, Washington|King County]], encouraging Metro Transit to accelerate the plan's timeline to open by 2000.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Bob |date=November 9, 1988 |title=Ballot Issues: On track, voters say 'hop to' on rail transit |page=E9 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> In 1990, the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] endorsed the creation of a regional transit board composed of politicians from King, [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce]], and [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish]] counties, with the goal of implementing the regional transit plan.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bergsman |first=Jerry |date=August 21, 1990 |title=Everett's OK may speed regional transit |page=C2 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> Several members of the [[Seattle City Council]] endorsed the rail plan on the condition that it pass through the Rainier Valley, by then an economically disadvantaged and majority-minority neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kelleher |first=Susan |date=July 16, 2001 |title=Distorted facts led to Rainier rail route |work=The Seattle Times |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010716&slug=rail16m |access-date=November 22, 2018}}</ref>

The escalators at Capitol Hill and University of Washington stations experienced several major failures and shutdowns in the two years since the University Link extension was opened. These failures were attributed to the installation of standard commercial escalators instead of stronger escalators designed for transit stations. A new escalator contractor was selected to provide preventative maintenance in lieu of a proposed replacement plan; new stairways and connecting passageways were also opened to allow for alternative access.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lindblom |first=Mike |date=October 25, 2018 |title=Sound Transit will add stairs and stronger escalators to fix UW Station breakdowns |work=The Seattle Times |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/sound-transit-will-add-stairs-and-stronger-escalators-to-fix-uw-station-breakdowns/ |url-access=limited |access-date=October 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Merten |first=Paxtyn |date=October 7, 2020 |title=Sound Transit scraps plans to replace UW Station escalators, citing performance improvements |work=Puget Sound Business Journal |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2020/10/07/uw-light-rail-station-escalators-replacement.html |access-date=September 13, 2021}}</ref> The Tukwila section of the line was shut down over one weekend in October 2018 for major repairs after cracks were discovered in the rails on the {{convert|1,200|ft|m|adj=mid}} bridge crossing [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lindblom |first=Mike |date=October 2, 2018 |title=Cracks in light-rail tracks slow trains in South Seattle; expect closures for repairs over weekend |work=The Seattle Times |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/cracks-in-light-rail-tracks-slow-trains-in-south-seattle-expect-closures-for-repairs-over-weekend/ |url-access=limited |access-date=October 25, 2018}}</ref>

In January 2020, Sound Transit began a ten-week construction project called "Connect 2020" that required trains to single-track in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. The closure of tracks for work on the [[2 Line (Sound Transit)|East Link Extension]] where it meets the existing tracks at International District/Chinatown necessitated the construction of a temporary [[center platform]] at Pioneer Square for use by through-riding passengers. Sound Transit deployed four-car trains running every 13–15 minutes and implemented restrictions on carrying bicyclists on trains through downtown.<ref name="Times-Connect">{{cite news |last=Lindblom |first=Mike |date=January 2, 2020 |title=Light-rail riders can expect more crowded, less frequent trains as downtown track construction begins |page=A1 |work=The Seattle Times |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/light-rail-riders-can-expect-more-crowded-less-frequent-trains-as-downtown-track-construction-begins/ |access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=January 8, 2020 |title=Connect 2020 Link schedules adjusting to every 13-15 minutes |work=The Platform |publisher=Sound Transit |url=https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/connect-2020-link-schedules-adjusting-to-every-13-15-minutes |access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> The project was completed in late March after a week-long delay in testing, but the frequency restrictions remained due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Washington (state)|coronavirus pandemic]] and local shutdowns.<ref>{{cite press release |date=March 22, 2020 |title=Connect 2020 concludes, ending Link light rail transfers at Pioneer Square and bicycle restrictions |url=https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/connect-2020-concludes-ending-link-light-rail-transfers |publisher=Sound Transit |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Groover |first1=Heidi |last2=Baruchman |first2=Michelle |date=March 15, 2020 |title=Light rail service disruptions will continue after problems discovered during downtown track work |work=The Seattle Times |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/light-rail-service-disruptions-will-continue-after-problems-discovered-during-downtown-track-work/ |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> Service was reduced to every 30 minutes in April and partially restored in September to every 8 minutes during peak hours and 15 minutes during most other hours.<ref>{{cite press release |date=April 16, 2020 |title=ST to temporarily reduce service further on Link and some ST Express routes |url=https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/st-to-temporarily-reduce-service-further-link-some-st |publisher=Sound Transit |access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |date=August 11, 2020 |title=Sound Transit to increase service on Link light rail effective September 19 |url=https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/sound-transit-to-increase-service-link-light-rail |publisher=Sound Transit |access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref> The first of the new "Series&nbsp;2" light rail vehicles, based on the [[Siemens S700 and S70|Siemens S700]], entered service in May 2021.<ref name="RA-Siemens"/>
