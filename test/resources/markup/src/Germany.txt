It is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous country in Europe]] after [[Russia]],{{efn|Excluding [[Turkey]]}} and the most populous [[member state of the European Union]]. Germany lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]] to the north and the [[Alps]] to the south. Its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]] have a total population of over 84 million, covering a combined area of {{convert|357600|km2|abbr=on}} and sharing land borders with [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west. The [[Capital of Germany|nation's capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|most populous city]] is [[Berlin]] and its main financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].

Settlement in what is now Germany began in the [[Lower Paleolithic]], with various tribes inhabiting it from the [[Neolithic]] onward, chiefly the [[Celts]]. Various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[List of early Germanic peoples|tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. In 962, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] formed the bulk of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]]. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815.

Formal [[unification of Germany]] into the modern nation-state commenced on 18 August 1866 with the [[North German Confederation Treaty]] establishing the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]-led [[North German Confederation]] later transformed in 1871 into the [[German Empire]]. After [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a totalitarian dictatorship]], [[World War II]], and [[the Holocaust]]. After the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|a period of Allied occupation]], in 1949, [[Inner German relations|Germany as a whole]] was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as [[West Germany]], and the German Democratic Republic, known as [[East Germany]], while Berlin continued its ''[[de jure]]'' [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four Power status]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the [[European Union]], while the German Democratic Republic was a communist [[Eastern Bloc]] state and member of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. After [[Peaceful Revolution|the fall]] of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|communist led-government]] in East Germany, [[German reunification]] saw the [[New states of Germany|former East German states]] join the Federal Republic of Germany on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].

Germany has been described as a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]]. As a global power in industrial, [[Science and technology in Germany|scientific and technological]] sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]]. As a [[developed country]] it offers [[Social security in Germany|social security]], [[Healthcare in Germany|a universal health care system]], and [[Education in Germany#Tertiary education|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is a member of the [[United Nations]], European Union, [[NATO]], [[Council of Europe]], [[G7]], [[G20]], and [[OECD]]. It has the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|third-greatest number]] of UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s.

=== Climate ===
Most of Germany has a [[temperate]] climate, ranging from [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] in the north and west to [[Continental climate|continental]] in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/Climate|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Germany: Climate|accessdate=23 March 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323124307/https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/Climate|archivedate=23 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} (Federal Diet) and {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}} (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body.

Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} and the {{lang|de|Bundesrat}}; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the [[rule of law]], are valid in perpetuity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf |title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany |date=October 2010 |website=Deutscher Bundestag |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619180331/https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2017 |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].

Since 2007, the democratic socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] has been a staple in the German {{lang|de|Bundestag}}, though they have never been part of the federal government.

German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky Brothers]] were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Potsdam]] was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with [[German expressionism|German expressionists]] such as [[Robert Wiene]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]]. Director [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as {{lang|de|[[Rubble film|Trümmerfilm]]}} (rubble film). East German film was dominated by state-owned film studio [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]], while the dominant genre in West Germany was the {{lang|de|[[Heimatfilm]]}} ("homeland film").<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen |last=Brockmann|title=A Critical History of German Film|url=https://archive.org/details/criticalhistoryg00broc |url-access=limited |publisher=Camden House|year= 2010|page= [https://archive.org/details/criticalhistoryg00broc/page/n296 286]|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.
