====Special effects====
The effects for all the APF series from ''Supercar'' to ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' were directed by [[Derek Meddings]], who later worked on the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' and ''[[Superman in film|Superman]]'' films.<ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;21.</ref> Knowing that ''Thunderbirds'' would be the "biggest project [APF] had worked on", Meddings found himself struggling to manage his workload with the single filming unit that had produced all the effects for ''Stingray''.<ref name="Bentley, 24"/><ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;104.</ref> He therefore established a second unit under technician [[Brian Johncock]], and a third exclusively for filming airborne sequences.<ref name="Bentley, 24 and 28">Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;24 and 28.</ref> This expansion increased the number of APF crews and stages to five each.<ref name="Bentley, 24 and 28"/> A typical episode contained around 100 effects shots;<ref name="Bignell, 76">Bignell, p.&nbsp;76.</ref><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;40.</ref> Meddings' team completed up to 18 per day.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;63.</ref>

An addition to the effects department was [[Mike Trim]], who served as Meddings' assistant in designing vehicles and buildings.<ref name="Bentley, 24"/><ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;60.</ref> Meddings and Trim jointly pioneered an "organic" design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children's toys.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;59.</ref><ref>Taylor and Trim, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> Models and sets were also "dirtied down" with powder paint or [[pencil lead]] to create a used look.<ref name="Andersonic9">{{Cite journal|date=Spring 2010|title=Interview: Mike Trim – Designs on the Future|journal=Andersonic|volume=1|issue=9|pages=4–12|editor=Farrell, Richard}}</ref><ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;22.</ref> Toy cars and vans were used in [[long shot]], while scale vehicles were equipped with basic steering and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] for added realism.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;57.</ref><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 107">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;107.</ref> Miniature fans and [[Jetex]] pellets, which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust, were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails.<ref name="Bentley, 25">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;25.</ref><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 107"/> Another of Meddings' inventions was a closed, cyclical effects stage nicknamed the "rolling road": a painted diorama consisting of two or more loops of canvas running at different speeds, this device allowed shots of apparently moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;21–22.</ref><ref>Bignell, p.&nbsp;79.</ref> Airborne aircraft sequences were similarly filmed against a "rolling sky", with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds.<ref name="Bentley, 22"/> However some flying sequences - such as the landings of Thunderbirds 1 and 2 at emergency sites - still required the models to be 'hand-flown' by operators who guided the models which were suspended by wires from a cruciform support/control frame.

Meddings' "rolling-road" set made its first appearance in the pilot episode "[[Trapped in the Sky]]" where it was showcased in the climactic sequence in which the crippled Fireflash airliner attempts an emergency landing with the assistance of International Rescue's Elevator Cars - and the results so impressed Lou Grade that he immediately approved the expansion of the episode from 30 minutes to a full hour. The rolling-road and rolling-sky sets were typical of Meddings' 'lateral thinking' approach to filming miniature effects - they provided major practical and aesthetic advantages that significantly reduced costs and filming time while greatly enhancing the visual realism and excitement of such action sequences. Meddings and his team knew that trying to physically 'fly' or 'drive' a miniature model through a fixed set with wires or rods produced results that were often unconvincing. This approach typically required large sets, took multiple takes and camera/lighting setups, the miniatures were difficult to film effectively, and it was hard to disguise the fact that the object on screen was simply a model on a wire. In the case of the Fireflash emergency landing sequence it would (at that time) arguably have been almost impossible to film the sequence in any other way, given that it was an elaborately choreographed sequence involving four miniatures moving in multiple directions along a 'runway' at high speed. By reversing the concept entirely - suspending the models in a fixed position and filming them against a moving continuous surface - it was relatively easy to shoot the miniatures from angles that would hide their control attachments, and virtually eliminated the 'wobbly' extraneous motions that usually detracted from the realism. Another major advantage of this technique was that it greatly simplified the work of the lighting and camera crews, making it possible to keep the models well-lit and in sharp focus at all times. Any motion of the models themselves was usually limited to small amounts of carefully-controlled lateral or vertical movement; additional motion effects could be simulated by blowing smoke or dust across the set in the opposite direction to the apparent direction of the miniature's movement, and by slowly tracking and/or zooming the camera past, towards or away from the model. Meddings' team also devised a convincing method to simulate a substantial road vehicle driving at speed by dusting the miniature road surface with a compound called [[fuller's earth]] and fitting the model cars and trucks with small gas 'puffer' devices that blew the dust from under the vehicle.

One of Meddings' first tasks was to shoot [[stock footage]] of the ''Thunderbird'' machines and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion.<ref name="Bentley, 21">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;21.</ref><ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;24.</ref> The finished island model was a composite of more than a dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the [[Stourhead|Stourhead Estate]] in Wiltshire.<ref name="La Rivière, 113">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;113.</ref> In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as [[associate producer]], Meddings was further tasked with designing the ''Thunderbird'' fleet and FAB 1.<ref name="Bentley, 12"/> Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/><ref name="Taylor and Trim, 12">Taylor and Trim, p.&nbsp;12.</ref> Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the ''Thunderbird'' machines were created for the series.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;42.</ref>

During the designing and filming process, Meddings' first priorities were realism and credibility.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> With the exception of ''Thunderbird 5'', each vehicle was built in three or four scales.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;93.</ref> Meddings' [[swing-wing]] concept for ''[[Thunderbird 1]]'' was inspired by his wish to create something "more dynamic" than a fixed-wing aircraft.<ref name="Meddings, 45">Meddings, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of ''[[Thunderbird 2]]'' until he inverted the wings, later commenting, "...&nbsp;at the time, all aircraft had swept-back wings. I only did it to be different."<ref name="Bentley, 13"/> This decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on Meddings' part.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 105">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;105.</ref><ref name="Meddings, 46">Meddings, p.&nbsp;46.</ref> He described the ''Thunderbird 2'' launch as "probably the most memorable" sequence that his team devised for an APF production.<ref name="Meddings, 46"/>

The largest model of ''[[Thunderbird 3]]'', whose design was based on the Soviet ''[[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]]'' rocket, was {{Convert|6|ft|spell=in}} tall.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/> ''[[Thunderbird 4]]'' was particularly difficult to film: as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank, creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> ''Thunderbird 5'', the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise, was based on the Tracy Island Round House.<ref name="Bentley, 14"/> Since most of the space station's appearances were provided by stock footage, the model was rarely filmed.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;58.</ref> Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode-by-episode basis and built from balsa wood, [[Jelutong]] wood or fibreglass.<ref>Meddings, pp.&nbsp;52 and 54.</ref> To save time and costs, other minor vehicles were built in-house from radio-controlled model kits.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/><ref name="Andersonic9"/>

As the puppets of Lady Penelope and Parker needed to fit inside, the largest of all the models was the seven-foot FAB 1, which cost £2,500 (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|2500|1964|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to build.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;13–14.</ref> The Rolls-Royce's name and colour were both chosen by Sylvia Anderson.<ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;65.</ref> [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce Ltd.]] supervised the construction of the plywood model and supplied APF with an authentic [[radiator grille]] for close-up shots of the front of the car.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 106"/><ref>La Rivière, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> In exchange for its cooperation, the company requested that a [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as "Rolls".<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 106">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;106.</ref><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;66.</ref>

By 1966, Meddings' commitments were split between Series Two and ''Thunderbirds Are Go''.<ref name="Bentley, 31"/> While Meddings worked on the film, camera operator Jimmy Elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the TV effects.<ref>Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> By this stage, the basic frame of ''Thunderbird 2'' had been damaged so many times that the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch.<ref name="La Rivière, 132">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;132.</ref> Meddings was displeased with the result, reflecting that the replacement was "not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape&nbsp;... I never felt our model-makers managed to recapture the look of the original."<ref name="La Rivière, 132"/>

Critic David Garland suggests that the challenge facing the ''Thunderbirds'' effects department was to strike a balance between the "conventional science-fiction imperative of the 'futuristic'" and the "seeping hyper-realist concerns mandated by the Andersons' approach to the puppets".<ref>Garland, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> ''Thunderbirds'' has been praised for the quality of its effects. Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, writers of ''Collins Telly Guide'', consider the model work "uniformly impressive".<ref name="Sangster and Condon">{{Cite book|title=Collins Telly Guide|author1=Sangster, Jim |author2=Condon, Paul |year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-00-719099-7|pages=758–760}}</ref> To [[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]], writers of ''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV'', the effects are "way beyond anything seen on TV previously".<ref name="Cornell, Day and Topping">{{Cite book|author=[[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]; [[Martin Day|Day, Martin]]; [[Keith Topping|Topping, Keith]]|title=The Guinness Book of Classic British TV|editor=Marshall, Anne|year=1996|origyear=1993|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-85112-628-9}}</ref> Impressed by their work on ''Thunderbirds'', film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] hired several members of Meddings' staff to supervise the effects shooting for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;143.</ref><ref>La Rivière, p.&nbsp;139.</ref>
