==Drawn with best play==

Adorján called Sveshnikov a "hypocrite" for making this statement (p. 72), noting that he is "the father of the [[Sicilian_Defense#Sveshnikov_Variation:_4...Nf6_5.Nc3_e5|Sveshnikov Variation]]" of the [[Sicilian Defense]], which is one of the most [[List of chess terms#Dynamism|dynamic]], complex, and imbalanced openings (de Firmian 2008, p. 336).</ref>

Chess theorists have long debated how enduring White's initiative is and whether, if both sides play perfectly, the game should end in a win for White or a draw. In 1889, World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz, widely considered the father of modern chess,<ref>{{cite book

The view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails. Rowson observes, "We do not know for a fact that the starting position is drawn, but it does seem like a safe assumption from a hypertheoretical point of view."<ref>Rowson 2005, p. 227. By "hypertheoretical point of view", Rowson means the viewpoint of an omniscient observer, one with a perfect understanding of chess (Rowson 2005, pp. 201–06). At the level of "hypertheory", the concept of an "advantage" for either side is meaningless, since there are only three possible assessments of a position: win for White, win for Black, or draw (Rowson 2005, p. 202).</ref> [[András Adorján | Adorján]] writes, "the logical outcome of the game is a draw."<ref>Adorján 2004, p. 17.</ref> Watson agrees, "the proper result of a perfectly played chess game ... is a draw. ... Of course, I can't prove this, but I doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree. ... I remember Kasparov, after a last-round draw, explaining to the waiting reporters: 'Well, chess is a draw.'"<ref>Watson 1998, p. 232. Rowson also quotes Kasparov as having said that chess is a draw. Rowson 2005, p. 202.</ref> [[Bobby Fischer]], like Kasparov a former World Champion, said, "I think it's almost definite that the game is a draw theoretically."<ref>{{cite book

While the "draw death" Capablanca feared has not occurred,<ref>Adorján 2005, p. 153, expressing agreement with GM [[Andor Lilienthal]].</ref> today some of the [[List of chess terms#Sharp|sharpest]] opening variations have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as [[List_of_chess_terms#Drawing_weapon|drawing weapons]]. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the [[Ruy Lopez#Marshall Attack|Marshall Attack]] in the [[Ruy Lopez]], a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances to obtain an endgame where Black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play.<ref>Watson 2006, pp. 161–62.</ref>

In 2007, GMs [[Kiril Georgiev]] and [[Atanas Kolev]] asserted that much the same was true of the so-called [[Poisoned Pawn Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation|Najdorf Sicilian]], which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6[[Chess_punctuation#.21.3F:_Interesting_move|!?]] This has long been considered one of the sharpest and most problematic (some would have said foolhardy)<ref>Watson observed that 7...Qb6 "is an astonishing move that those raised with classical chess principles would simply reject as a typical beginner's mistake. Black goes running after a pawn when he is undeveloped and already under attack." Watson 2006, p. 199.</ref><ref>[[Siegbert Tarrasch]] wrote in his classic [[treatise]] ''The Game of Chess'', "It is very dangerous to make a raid with the Queen early on in the game.
