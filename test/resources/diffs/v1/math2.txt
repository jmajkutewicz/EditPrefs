===Hamilton–Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates===
The constancy of the LRL vector can also be derived from the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates {{nowrap|1=(''ξ'', ''η'')}}, which are defined by the equations

:<math>
\xi = r + x,
</math>
:<math>
\eta = r - x,
</math>

where ''r'' represents the radius in the plane of the orbit

:<math>
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
</math>

The inversion of these coordinates is

:<math>
x = \frac{1}{2} (\xi - \eta),
</math>
:<math>
y = \sqrt{\xi\eta},
</math>

Separation of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in these coordinates yields the two equivalent equations<ref name="landau_lifshitz_1976" /><ref>{{cite journal | last = Dulock | first = V.

2\xi p_\xi^2 - mk - mE\xi = -\Gamma,
</math>
:<math>
2\eta p_\eta^2 - mk - mE\eta = \Gamma,
</math>

where Γ is a constant of motion.  Subtraction and re-expression in terms of the Cartesian momenta ''p''<sub>''x''</sub> and ''p''<sub>''y''</sub> shows that Γ is equivalent to the LRL vector

:<math>
\Gamma = p_y (x p_y - y p_x) - mk\frac{x}{r} = A_x.
