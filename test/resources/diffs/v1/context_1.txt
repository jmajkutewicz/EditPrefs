Despite the success of ''Alien'', its sequel took years to develop; it was delayed by lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from [[20th Century Fox]], and repeated changes in management. Based on his scripts for ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), Cameron was hired to write a story for ''Aliens'' in 1983. The project stalled again until new Fox executive [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] advocated a sequel. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was given the director role based on his success directing ''The Terminator''. On an approximately $18.5{{nbsp}}million budget, ''Aliens'' began [[principal photography]] in September 1985. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at [[Pinewood Studios]] over their work habits and Cameron's relative inexperience. [[James Horner]] composed the film's score. The difficult shoot also affected Horner, who was given little time to record the music.
