===Casimir invariants and the energy levels===
The [[Casimir invariant]]s for negative energies are
<math display="block"> \begin{align}
C_1 &= \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{L} = \frac{mk^2}{2|E|}, \\
C_2 &= \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{L} = 0,
\end{align}</math>

and have vanishing Poisson brackets with all components of {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}},
<math display="block">
\{ C_1, L_i \} = \{ C_1, D_i\} =
\{ C_2, L_i \} = \{ C_2, D_i \} = 0.
</math>
''C''<sub>2</sub> is trivially zero, since the two vectors are always perpendicular.

However, the other invariant, ''C''<sub>1</sub>, is non-trivial and depends only on {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|E}}. Upon canonical quantization, this invariant allows the energy levels of [[hydrogen-like atom]]s to be derived using only quantum mechanical canonical commutation relations, instead of the conventional solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation.<ref name="bohm_1993" /><ref name="ReferenceA" /> This derivation is discussed in detail in the next section.
