After the North Tower collapsed, some firefighters entered 7&nbsp;World Trade Center to search the building. They attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire, but low water pressure hindered their efforts.<ref name="lr3En" /> Over the course of the day, fires burned out of control on several floors of 7 World Trade Center, the flames visible on the east side of the building.<ref name="4qq59" /> During the afternoon, the fire was also seen on floors 6–10, 13–14, 19–22, and 29–30.<ref name="NIST-june2004" />{{rp|24 (PDF p. 28)}} In particular, the fires on floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 continued to burn out of control during the afternoon.<ref name="nist-questions" /> At approximately 2:00&nbsp;pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse.<ref name="hayden" /> During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building.<ref name="19xch" /> Around 3:30&nbsp;pm, FDNY Chief of Operations [[Daniel A. Nigro]] decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7&nbsp;World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel.<ref name="S0RDT" /> The fire expanded the girders of the building, causing some to lose their structural integrity. This led column number 79, a critical column supporting a large part of the 13th floor, to buckle, causing the floors above it to collapse to the fifth floor; however, this could not be seen from outside the building. The structure also developed cracks in the facade just before the entire building started to fall.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|21}}<ref name=":0" /> According to FEMA, this collapse started at 5:20:33&nbsp;pm EDT when the east mechanical penthouse started crumbling.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|23}}<ref name=":1" /> Differing times are given as to what time the building completely collapsed:<ref name=":1" /> at 5:21:10&nbsp;pm EDT according to FEMA,<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|23}} and at 5:20:52&nbsp;pm EDT according to NIST.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|19, 21, 50–51}} There were no [[casualty (person)|casualties]] associated with the collapse.<ref name=":0" /> NIST found no evidence to support [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories#7 World Trade Center|conspiracy theories]] such as the collapse being the result of explosives; it found that a combination of factors including physical damage, fire, and the building's unusual construction set off a chain-reaction collapse.<ref name="2OBAX" />
