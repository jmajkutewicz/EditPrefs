{{quote box|quote=Before it started to rain I was quite comfortable, and I was just focused on having a clean race. Then it started to drizzle and I didn't want to take any risks&nbsp;– but Sebastian [Vettel] got past me and I was told that I had to get back in front of him. I couldn't believe it. Then at the very last corner I managed to get past Timo [Glock]&nbsp;– it was just amazing. This was one of the toughest races of my life, if not the toughest. I was shouting, 'Do I have it? Do I have it?' on the radio. It was only when I took the chequered flag and got to turn one that the team told me I was world champion.

Kubica's finish in 11th&nbsp;position meant that he lost third place in the championship to Räikkönen. After the race, Kubica said: "We made too many mistakes during the weekend and this is the result."<ref name="racebrabmwq" /> His team said that they had received the wrong information about track conditions at the start of the race, which led them to keep the Polish driver's car on dry-weather tyres when the rest of the field had changed to intermediates.<ref name="racebrabmwq" />

David Coulthard expressed his disappointment in his early exit from his final Formula One race, saying: "I'm pretty gutted, it's not how I wanted to end my career."
